# phantom tools
These are scripts/programs used to make, pre-process, filter and work over
the datasets or files that are required for building the phantom models (not
those built by other people/groups).

Each directory holds the files for one tool. Some tools may have different
dependencies than phantom, or depend on phantom itself.
