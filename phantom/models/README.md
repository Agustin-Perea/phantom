Check the license on that repo, but on simple terms:

* dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat has been trained with datasets
  that are licensed under Creative Commons.
* mmod_human_face_detector.dat has been trained with publicly available
  images, further annotated by Davis King.
* shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat has been trained on publicly available
  images, annotated by Davis King.
* shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat has been trained on a dataset that
  __*restricts commercial use*__.
* phantom_gender_model_v1.dat has been trained on a subset selected from
  dlibs 5 point face landmark dataset, and hence is publicly available.

In the future, we're expecting to add new datasets that are complementary to
these ones.
