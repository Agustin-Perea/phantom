# phantom
a library for working with faces in python

## Requirements
* Python 3.6.x
* NumPy 1.15+
* OpenCV 3.4+
* dlib 19.8.1

## Installing on Windows
Since Windows tends to be a bit harder to get things working on, we have
compiled this instructions to get you going:

1. Get latest Python 3.6.x.
2. Install Numpy and OpenCV from Christoph Golhkes wheels 
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/.
3. Download wheel for dlib from https://pypi.org/simple/dlib/ (thanks to
https://github.com/charlielito/install-dlib-python-windows for the pointer)

Linux and macOS should be easier. If you have problems, point us at it so that
we can work out detailed instructions.
